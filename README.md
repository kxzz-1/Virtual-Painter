Virtual Painter
This is a computer vision project that lets you draw on the screen using your fingers and a webcam. It uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect your hand and fingers in real time.

How it works
- When only the index finger is up, you can draw on the screen by moving your finger.
- When both the index and middle fingers are up, it switches to selection mode. You can choose different colors, the eraser, or clear the canvas by moving your fingers over the options at the top of the screen.

The application tracks your fingertip positions and draws lines based on your movements.
Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
